## Project Overview

Customer churn is a major concern in the telecom industry. This project analyzes customer churn data to:
- Understand what drives customer churn through EDA
- Build predictive models to flag potential churners
By identifying key patterns, Telcos can proactively address customer needs and improve retention.

## Repository Structure
- /data → Raw and processed datasets
- /notebooks → Jupyter notebooks for EDA and modeling
- /outputs → Model results, reports, and logs
- /images → Visualizations for documentation and presentation


## Dataset
- **Source**: [Telco Customer Churn - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)
- **Description**: The dataset includes customer details like demographics, services signed up for, contract information, payment method, and whether the customer churned.

## Objectives

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understand feature distributions
   - Identify churn patterns
   - Explore relationships between demographics, services, and churn

2. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Build and compare machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
   - Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix
   - Identify key drivers of customer churn


## Status: In Progress

-  Repository setup
-  Folder structure organized
-  Dataset integrated
-  EDA and modeling in progress
-  Dashboard and documentation
